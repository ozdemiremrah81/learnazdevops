AZ400 Notes:

When you create a value stream map, or VSM, it helps you analyze your current release-cycle process. The purpose of a VSM is to visually show where in the process a team creates value and where there's waste. The goal is to arrive at a process that delivers maximum value to the customer with minimum waste. A VSM can help you pinpoint those areas that either don't contribute any value or that actually reduce the value of the product.
